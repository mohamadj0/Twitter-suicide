# *Prediction of suicidal thoughts from X social networks*

In today's world, social networks have become one of the important platforms for human communication and expression of feelings. Due to the ever-increasing use of these platforms, especially Twitter (now called X), generates huge data of user dialogues and expressions. These data can not only express the opinions and feelings of users, but also act as a vital source for identifying psychological problems such as depression and suicidal thoughts. In this project, we intend to use advanced neural network models, especially LSTM, to analyze and predict suicidal thoughts among X users and identify people who may be at risk. This analysis, by focusing on the feelings in the shared texts, can help to prevent unfortunate processes and ensure the mental health of society.

In this project, we investigate and analyze the suicidal thoughts of users of social networks X (formerly Twitter) by relying on neural network models, especially LSTM. Our main goal is to identify and predict those who may be subject to depression and suicidal thoughts. Due to the huge amount of textual data produced by users, we can identify the feelings and emotions hidden in these texts by using deep learning algorithms.
Because of their special capabilities in processing time sequences and learning high-level features from data, LSTM models are a very suitable tool for detecting emotional and psychological patterns in texts. These models can help us identify signs of depression and suicidal thoughts through deep text analysis and equip people at risk.
Finally, we hope that by using these new technologies and methods, we will be able to reveal the hidden mental problems of the society and take an effective step towards improving people's mental health. This project not only helps to save the lives of people at risk, but also provides the necessary background to create a society that is aware and sensitive to mental problems.

# DataSet

The data set used in this project contains approximately 200,000 records of different texts, which are divided into two major categories, i.e. texts related to suicide and texts related to non-suicide. These texts have been collected with high accuracy and sensitivity from users who are generally people who have had suicidal thoughts or have taken actions in this direction.
Texts with the theme of suicide are written by users who are exposed to serious psychological injuries and are searching for help or confessing their problems. These texts allow us to gain a deeper understanding of the feelings, thoughts and challenges these people face.
On the other hand, texts related to non-suicide belong to other users who, despite expressing their feelings and personal experiences, are not involved in hopeless thoughts and continue to live and survive. Collecting these data gives us the opportunity to identify the differences and similarities between these two categories and to analyze more precisely the factors that contribute to the occurrence of suicidal thoughts.
Overall, this dataset not only allows us to identify deep behavioral and emotional patterns among different users, but can also help create effective and targeted strategies to help those at risk.

# Result 

Finally, after performing detailed analyzes and applying advanced neural network models, significant accuracy was obtained in predicting suicidal thoughts and identifying symptoms related to it. This accuracy was recorded as 97.38%, which represents our remarkable success in using modern technologies to identify risky behaviors and signs of psychological vulnerability.

This number not only shows the efficiency of the algorithms used in this project, but also shows our ability to understand the psychological and emotional complexities of humans. Having high accuracy in prediction allows us to more effectively identify and help people who are at risk, and we hope that through this achievement, we can take an effective step towards improving the mental health of society. .
